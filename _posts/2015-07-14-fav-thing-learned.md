I have learned so many things in the rockit bootcamp that it is hard
for me to choose only one thing that I think of as my favorite thing
learned. All the teachers have been so wonderful and helpful in teaching 
everything so far.

Brig especially seems to really connect with his students and pass his 
obvious passion for the craft on to all observers. I find myself feeling
so lucky and full of exitement whenever brig gives one of his awesome 
lectures.

But if I had to pick one thing that I've learned in this class to be my 
favorite I'd have to say responsive web-design would have to be it. It is
amazing what you can do with websites and the @media property.
